# MIT-COVID19-Model-Evaluation

Repository for code to evaluate the COVID-19 Models being used by different institutes and proposed to the Indian government. 

Models provided to Indian Government: 
* CDDEP (aka Johns Hopkins) model (SEIR model with +)
* Cambrdige model (SEIR model with +)  
* UMichigan model (SEIR model with +)

Other well-known models being used by governments/media:
* Imperial College model (Stochastic agent/Individual-based model)
* Oxford study (SEIR with Bayesian estimates)

These models provide a varied range of predictions which make it hard for policy-makers to decide courses of action to control the epidemic.
